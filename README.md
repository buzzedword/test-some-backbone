==================
Help a sister out?

## My Goal
Use MV* and jQuery, Backbone, and Underscore to serve simple page views via a button that is clicked.  I am starting with two views (home and about) each containing a title and a button.  

On $(document).ready(function() {}); I would like the template to load the home page with the associated homeModel attributes. So; the h1 would contain 'Home Title' and the button would read 'Click to get to the About Pg'.

I don't really want it to be more complicated than that. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I will leave questions and comments in readme files located in each folder in the MV* related to the .js file I'm working with.  There also may be questions and my thinking included in the codes comments.
